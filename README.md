# Synthosphere_design_hackathon
This documentation contains detailed explanation of design and synthesis of a digital delay timer used for generating programmable delay

# Note : Design file, testbench, post-synthesis design files, waveforms of pre-synthesis and post-synthesis and related files can be found in Design files folder.

Our goal is to perform pre-synthesis and post-sythesis on the design which in our case is a digital delay timer used for generating programmable delay. It consists of four operating modes : one-shot (OS), Delayed Operate (DO), Delayed Release(DR), Dual Delay (DD). Those four modes will be selected by inputs mode_a and mode_b.
